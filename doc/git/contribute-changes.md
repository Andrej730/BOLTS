This tutorial assumes you have obtained a development checkout, commited some changes or additions (like adding a collection or a drawing), and now want to contribute them back to the main BOLTS branch.

There are many different ways of doing that. The preferred ones are to send a bundle with your changes by email, or if you use GitHub, to open a pull request. Other ways include sending patches or publishing your git repo on a publicly accessible server.
