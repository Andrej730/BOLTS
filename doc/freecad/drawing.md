### Scope

The main purpose of drawings in BOLTS is to give a quick visual explanation of
the meaning of the parameters of the class. It is not a full-fledged technical
drawing, whose purpose is to provide all the informations necessary to produce
the part. Nevertheless we borrow some conventions and techniques from technical
drawings.

This is an explanation to create a drawing for a class of parts that is
available in BOLTS for FreeCAD. Whether this is the case for a class can be
checked on its page:
