You need to have [python](http://www.python.org/) (Version 2.7) and [pyyaml](http://pyyaml.org/) installed.

### Download a BOLTS for FreeCAD release

You can find the most recent BOLTS for FreeCAD release at the [Downloads Page]({{ site.baseurl}}/downloads.html).

There are different archive types available, if you are unsure, which to choose use the zip.


### Extract it to your macro folder

You can look up the location of the macro folder in the preferences: Choose
Edit->Preferences, in the dialog select the macro tab. The macro path is listed
there. On linux the macro folder is usually located at `~/.FreeCAD`.

When you are done the macro folder should contain a subfolder called BOLTS and
a file called start_bolts.FCMacro

The installation is now complete.
