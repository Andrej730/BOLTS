explore fcstd bases

OpenSCAD Backend
----------------

OpenSCAD parser to make base-args superfluous.
OpenSCAD GUI?
OpenSCAD library
BOLT.scad: unified warning and error functions
add dimension checks everywhere
zero coordinates for axis: cross doesn't work everywhere (see hex_socket1). dashed lines?
warning when superseeded standards are used
license header
NopHead assembly and bom mechanisms
proper dependencies (bitmap font)
maybe special mode for differencing (smaller diameter for threaded parts for tapping, larger diameter for hex traps, ...)

BLT
---

explore git integration (git repo url in collection header?, automatic updating?, submodules?)
script: generate task list

spec: define concepts and use them consistently: dimensions or measures, base definitions, dimension lookup
spec: choices for parameters, for example the length of bolts.

Parts
