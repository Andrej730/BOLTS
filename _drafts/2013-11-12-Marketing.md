On a sidenote: BOLTS now has a nice [description page](http://freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Macro_BOLTS) on the FreeCAD wiki. Almost immediately after I added the english version, FreeCAD user mario52 improved it and translated it to [French](http://freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Macro_BOLTS/fr) and [Italian](http://freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Macro_BOLTS/it). I could then copy from that to create a [German](http://freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Macro_BOLTS/de) version, so it is now available in four languages.
