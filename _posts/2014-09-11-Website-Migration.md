I recently migrated the BOLTS website from GitHub pages to a new domain:

[http://www.bolts-library.org](http://www.bolts-library.org)

The old website was shut down and only shows a notice redirecting the user to the new page. This blog will not be used anymore, please update your subscription to the new feed

[http://www.bolts-library.org/en/blog/atom.xml](http://www.bolts-library.org/en/blog/atom.xml)

I wrote a blog post (on the [new blog](http://www.bolts-library.org/en/blog/index.html) about the migration:
