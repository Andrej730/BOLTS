    <h3>What can I do?</h3>
    <p>There are loads of things that you can do to help improve BOLTS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>make suggestions how to improve the website and the documentation or report problems</li>
      <li>report or even fix errors in part specifications</li>
      <li>suggest or add parts that are still missing</li>
      <li>give feedback on the workflow in the different CAD applications and how to improve it</li>
      <li>create drawings for the online specification pages</li>
      <li>dive in the code of bolttools and fix bugs, extend and improve it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>BOLTS scans its database for inconsistencies, common problems, missing or unclear informations and automatically generates <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/html/tasks.html">a list of things that should be fixed or improved</a>. This is a great starting point for contributing to BOLTS</p>

    <h3>How to do that?</h3>
    <p>For many of the things suggested above there are detailed guides in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/index.html">Documentation section</a>.</p>
    <p>There are several ways to report problems or make suggestions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Problems with the documentation can be reported via the comments section embedded on each page.</p>
      <li>For FreeCAD related things, there is a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/free-cad/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=4549">development thread</a> on the FreeCAD forums.
      <li>The <a href="https://github.com/jreinhardt/BOLTS/issues">BOLTS issue tracker</a> on GitHub is also a good place to report problems and discuss improvements.</li>
    </ul>
