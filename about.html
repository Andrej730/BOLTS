      <h3 id="section-1">The Problem</h3>
      <p>With the maker movement gaining momentum and 3D printers becoming more mainstream, many free and open CAD software packages have started to appear. However, most of them miss a library of standard parts, while other feature only a comparably small library or have many small packages with often used parts scattered over the whole internet.</p>
      <p>The problem is, that standard parts are not very exciting, they are mostly boring nuts and bolts. Plus there are many different standards, all slightly different, which makes everything even more annoying.</p>

      <h3 id="section-2">The vision</h3>
      <p> The vision of BOLTS is to make it easy for many different CAD packages to have a useful library of standard parts b:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Encouraging synergies by building on a common, data base
        <li> Eliminating boring tasks by automation
        <li> Encourage contributions, by breaking things down in to small and easy tasks
      </ul>
